# loic-nazaries-website

Building a web site with [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo Framework"), a static site generator.

The theme used is [Somrat](https://themes.gohugo.io/somrat/ "Somrat Theme"), authored by [Somrat Sorkar](https://github.com/somratpro/somrat/blob/master/LICENSE "Somrat Sorkar").

This repository is the source for my website (see "github-pages-website" repo).

When the present repo is altered, the content of the "public" folder should be moved to the "github-pages-website" repo.
The "public" folder is not synchronised on this repo, and rather kept locally before synching with the "github-pages-website" repo.
